title: Known RMM Tool Process Execution
id: b8c2d4e6-f8a0-4b2c-9d3e-5f7a9b1c3d5e
status: experimental
description: >
  Detects execution of known Remote Management and Monitoring (RMM) tool processes.
  Research-level rule for baselining RMM tool usage across the environment. High false
  positive rate expected due to legitimate IT use. Use to establish a baseline of
  approved RMM instances before promoting to hunt-level detection.

# ─── Research Notes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Build a whitelist of approved:
#   - RMM tool names and versions
#   - Source user accounts (IT staff only)
#   - Parent processes (installer, IT deployment system)
#   - Network destinations (approved RMM vendor infrastructure)
# Anything outside this baseline is a candidate for promotion to Hunt/Analyst level.
