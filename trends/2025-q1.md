# 2025 Threat Trends — Q1

**Reporting Period:** Q1 2025 (January - March)
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-15

## Executive Summary

- **TTR Compression Continues**: Median ransomware dwell time now <24 hours (Mandiant M-Trends 2025)
- **IAB Market Expansion**: Infostealer-to-ransomware pipeline now dominant access method (HudsonRock, RedCanary)
- **ClickFix Evolution**: New variants emerge quarterly, same chokepoint remains stable
- **RMM Tool Abuse Stable**: Detections forcing tool rotation but not technique abandonment (Cyberint)

---

## Hot Chokepoints (High Activity)

### 1. Renamed RMM Tools
**Threat Level:** Critical
**Prevalence:** Very High
**Trend:** ↑ Increasing

**What's Happening:**
- AnyDesk declining after detection improvements
- ScreenConnect now primary choice
- RustDesk emerging as self-hosted alternative
- "RMM-to-RMM" deployments (one deploys another for redundancy)

**Why It Matters:**
- Initial access AND persistent C2 in single tool
- Legitimate signed binaries evade many defenses
- User interaction barrier lower than malware execution

**Detection Focus:**
- Browser download + masqueraded filenames
- File metadata mismatch (OriginalFilename vs. actual name)
- User-initiated vs. IT-deployed RMM

**Chokepoint Stability:** High (detection patterns remain valid)
**Chokepoint Entry:** [renamed-rmm-tools.yml](../chokepoints/initial-access/renamed-rmm-tools.yml)

---

### 2. ClickFix Variants
**Threat Level:** High
**Prevalence:** High
**Trend:** ↑ Increasing

**What's Happening:**
- ClickFix → FileFix → TerminalFix → DownloadFix progression
- New variants every 6-8 weeks
- Targeting both consumer and enterprise users
- Social engineering improving (more convincing pretexts)

**Why It Matters:**
- Low technical barrier for attackers
- High success rate (user psychology exploitation)
- Bypasses email security (no malicious attachment)

**Detection Focus:**
- Script interpreter (powershell.exe, cmd.exe) with browser parent
- Outbound network connection from scripting process
- Encoded/obfuscated command lines

**Chokepoint Stability:** Very High (clipboard → execution pattern unchanged)

**Prediction:** Q2 2025 will see mobile-focused variants (iOS/Android clipboard abuse)

**Chokepoint Entry:** [clickfix-techniques.yml](../chokepoints/initial-access/clickfix-techniques.yml)
**Free Intel:** [ClickGrab](../intel/clickgrab.md) — payload collection from active ClickFix infrastructure

---

### 3. Service Manipulation (Ransomware Prep)
**Threat Level:** Critical
**Prevalence:** High
**Trend:** → Stable

**What's Happening:**
- Comprehensive kill lists (50+ products)
- Backup services now prioritized over AV/EDR
- ESXi-specific service targeting increasing
- Faster execution (service stops compressed to <5 minutes)

**Why It Matters:**
- Final warning before encryption begins
- Detection window narrowing as automation improves
- Cloud/hypervisor targeting reduces endpoint visibility

**Detection Focus:**
- Multiple security/backup services stopped in short window
- Network logon + service manipulation (remote ransomware)
- After-hours service stop activity

**Chokepoint Stability:** Very High (service manipulation requirements unchanged)
**Chokepoint Entry:** [ransomware-service-manipulation.yml](../chokepoints/defense-evasion/ransomware-service-manipulation.yml)

---

### 4. Infostealer Credential Harvesting
**Threat Level:** Critical
**Prevalence:** Very High
**Trend:** ↑↑ Rapidly Increasing

**What's Happening:**
- 50% increase in infections (2024 vs 2023) — HudsonRock
- Session token theft now standard (MFA bypass)
- IAB marketplace maturation
- Enterprise-focused campaigns increasing

**Why It Matters:**
- Enables entire RaaS ecosystem
- Compresses attacker timelines (pre-mapped environments)
- MFA no longer sufficient defense alone
- Detection often occurs post-compromise

**Detection Focus:**
- Browser credential file access by non-browser processes
- Large data exfiltration from user workstations
- Execution from Downloads folder

**Chokepoint Stability:** High (browser storage access patterns consistent)

**Impact:** Expect continued TTR compression due to IAB efficiency
**Attack Chain:** [infostealers.md](../attack-chains/infostealers.md)

---

## Declining Chokepoints (Lower Activity)

### Legacy RDP Brute Force
**Trend:** ↓ Decreasing

**Why Declining:**
- Network detection improved
- MFA adoption increasing
- Attackers prefer stolen credentials (infostealers)

**Chokepoint Status:** Still valid, but lower priority

---

### Email Macro Malware
**Trend:** ↓↓ Significantly Decreasing

**Why Declining:**
- Microsoft disabled macros by default (2022)
- User awareness improved
- Attackers shifted to alternate vectors (ISO, LNK, HTML smuggling)

**Chokepoint Status:** Evolving to new file types; see [chokepoint-shifts.md](./chokepoint-shifts.md)

---

## New Tool Capabilities

### Q1 2025 — Impacket RDP Shadowing
**Tool:** Impacket rdp_shadow.py
**Date:** 2025-01-15
**Impact:** Low (existing chokepoint coverage)

**Details:**
- PR#2064 adds native RDP session hijacking to Impacket suite
- Joins existing lateral movement module set
- Same prerequisites as other RDP hijacking methods

**Detection Impact:**
- Existing RDP session manipulation detections apply (Event ID 4624 LogonType 10)
- No new chokepoint created
- Monitor for adoption Q2-Q3

**Chokepoint:** [remote-execution-tools.yml](../chokepoints/lateral-movement/remote-execution-tools.yml)

## Ecosystem Trends

### RaaS/IAB Dynamics

**Time to Ransom (TTR) Compression:**
```
2020: Average 21 days
2022: Average 7 days
2024: Average 2 days
2025: Median <24 hours     ← Mandiant M-Trends 2025
```

**Root Cause:**
- Initial Access Brokers (IABs) sell pre-authenticated access (Cyberint)
- Attackers skip reconnaissance phase
- Credentials + network maps included in IAB sales
- Automation of post-access phases

**Detection Implication:**
- Less time for detection and response
- Emphasis on preventing initial access critical
- Credential theft detection becomes highest priority
- Assume breach mentality required

---

### Tool Rotation Patterns

**Observation:**
Attackers rotate tools when detection rates increase, but chokepoints remain stable.

**Example — RMM Tool Migration:**
```
2020-2022: AnyDesk dominant
2022-2023: ScreenConnect adoption increases
2023-2024: AnyDesk declines, ScreenConnect primary
2024-2025: RustDesk emergence as self-hosted option
```

**Chokepoint Constant:**
- Browser download + file masquerading
- User execution
- Outbound connection to RMM infrastructure

**Strategy:**
Focus detection on chokepoints, not specific tools.

## Predictions: Q2-Q4 2025

### High Confidence (80%+)

**RMM Tool Evolution:**
- Continued rotation away from blocked tools
- Increase in self-hosted/open-source RMM (RustDesk, MeshCentral)
- More sophisticated masquerading (valid cert spoofing)

**Infostealer Growth:**
- 20-30% increase in infections
- Targeting of password managers directly
- Mobile device credential theft increases

**Ransomware TTR:**
- Median drops below 12 hours
- Automated playbooks from access to encryption
- Targeting of cloud infrastructure increases

### Medium Confidence (50-70%)

**ClickFix Mobile Variants:**
- iOS/Android clipboard-based attacks
- Targeting of enterprise mobile management (EMM) gaps
- QR code social engineering integration

**AI-Enhanced Social Engineering:**
- Voice cloning for vishing campaigns
- Deepfake video for executive impersonation
- AI-generated phishing content at scale

### Low Confidence (30-50%)

**Zero-Click Exploitation:**
- Decline in user-interaction requirements
- Browser/OS exploit chains become accessible
- Detection shifts from user-action to exploitation artifacts

- LSASS protection (PPL, Credential Guard)
- Browser credential file monitoring
- Session token theft detection

**Priority 2: Lateral Movement Containment**
- Network segmentation enforcement
- Admin account monitoring
